Tasks 👨‍💼

👨‍💼: I'm trying to organise my list of all the best places to go for Sunday brunch so I know how to help my users produce the best content for their "social".

👨‍💼: Can you help me organise this list a bit better? It's unfriendly at best at the moment.

First job - it seems a bit broken! Let's fix it. One of the places on the list doesn't look like it's displaying correctly. (Look for 🐨 to help out).

Let's sort the list into alphabetical order, so it's easier to understand. (💰 is surely able to help us out with this?)

💯 : It seems that some of the text is formatted a bit badly. Let's make every word start with a capital letter

Hint: you can do the extension with CSS, or Javascript, 🐨 prefers CSS, 💰 prefers Javascript,so it's really up to whoever you prefer.
